NAME
    Encode::DoubleEncodedUTF8 - Fix double encoded UTF-8 bytes to the
    correct one

SYNOPSIS
      use Encode;
      use Encode::DoubleEncodedUTF8;

      my $string = "\x{5bae}";
      my $bytes  = encode_utf8("\x{5bae}");
      my $dodgy_utf8 = $string . $bytes; # $bytes is now double encoded

      my $fixed = decode("utf-8-de", encode_utf8($dodgy_utf8)); # "\x{5bae}\x{5bae}"

DESCRIPTION
    Encode::DoubleEncodedUTF8 adds a new encoding "utf-8-de" and fixes
    double encoded utf-8 bytes found in the original bytes to the correct
    Unicode entity.

    The double encoded utf-8 frequently happens when strings with UTF-8 flag
    and without are concatenated. See encoding::warnings for details.
